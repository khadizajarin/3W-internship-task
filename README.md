# Task Planet UI/UX Improvement - ReactJS

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Task Planet app improvement task, where the objective is to enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of two selected sections. The improvements are aimed at demonstrating my technical and design skills by building upon the initial feedback provided in the internship task. The two selected sections for UI/UX enhancements are:

1. **Leaderboard Section**
2. **Social Media Task Section**

The improved designs have been implemented using ReactJS, and the project is deployed on Netlify for easy access.

## Tech Stack
- **ReactJS**: Used for building the interactive UI components.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and improving the visual layout of the selected sections.
- **Netlify**: Hosting platform for deploying the web pages.
- **GitHub**: Code repository management.

## Improvements Made
